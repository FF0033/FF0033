I've been looking into getting a dancepad for stepmania. I couldn't stand the soft pads, and although I haven't tried a foam pad, they don't seem to be very available in the UK anymore.

There are two projects that really interest me:

## Omega 4x
These pads, available from precisiondancepads, a cute company in the US seem to be my best option at the moment. I like the very minimal design, and some of the custom prints look incredible. However, it's fairly expensive at $350 + $150 shipping to UK + import tax and handling - Ouch!

## Impulse
This project is not commercially available yet, but looks extremely promising. It's more similar in style to the more traditional pads (ie. physically visual seperate panels), which I personally prefer. Although, unlike other metal pads of the same style, it does not appear to have any nasty screws sticking out. It looks gorgeous, and those lights! wow!

## Making the leap
I've ended up making an Omega 4x purchase, which i'm pretty excited about; having a big anime face printed on the board will make me happy. But, I've also been inspired to try creating my own - so while i wait patiently for my Omega to arrive, I'm going to attempt to design at least a basic pad of my own, something which I can build upon. Also, having read some build guides on a forum from 2006, i'm pretty much qualified. I can do this, I think!

How do they make the lights shine and glow out of the panels? howwww! :)
